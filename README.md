# QuadReals

A quad-double number (Quad) is an unevaluated sum of four IEEE double precision numbers, capable of representing at least 212 bits of significand. Algorithms for various arithmetic operations (including the four basic operations and various algebraic and transcendental operations) are presented. A Swift implementation of these algorithms is attached, along with its interfaces.
